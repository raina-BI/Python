# Generate Random Strings with OOP and Tkinter

This Python program generates random strings using a **3D array** and implements **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The program features a user-friendly GUI built with **Tkinter** for real-time string generation and visualization.

## Features
- **Random String Generation**:
  - Strings are composed of random characters selected from digits, special symbols, and uppercase letters.
- **Dynamic Buttons**:
  - Creates new buttons dynamically to generate more strings on the fly.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Displays the generated string and keeps a count of total generated strings.
  - Shows a list of all generated strings in a scrollable text box.
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Encapsulates functionalities within the `CreateElements` class for modularity.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Tkinter** library (included with Python).

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the program in a Python 3.x environment:
