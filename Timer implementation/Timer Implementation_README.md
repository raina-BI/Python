# Countdown Timer

This Python script implements a countdown timer that takes an input in seconds, counts down, and displays the remaining time in the `MM:SS` format. When the time reaches zero, it outputs a message saying "Time is up!"

## Features

- **Countdown in Minutes and Seconds**: The timer displays the remaining time in `MM:SS` format.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The timer updates every second in place, showing the current time remaining without printing a new line.
- **User Input**: The user provides the countdown time in seconds.
- **Input Validation**: The script checks for valid integer input and ensures the countdown time is positive.
- **Message upon Completion**: Once the countdown finishes, a "Time is up!" message is displayed.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
