# Honors List with Encapsulation

This Python program demonstrates the concept of **Encapsulation** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using a student grading system. It includes a simple GUI built with **Tkinter** to display student details and identify those who qualify for the honors list.

## Features
- Implements **Encapsulation** to manage private variables and methods in a `Student` class.
- Uses a **GUI with Tkinter** to display student details and honors list dynamically.
- Calculates honors status for students based on their marks.

## Concept: Encapsulation
Encapsulation is achieved by:
1. Declaring private variables and methods using a double underscore (`__`).
2. Accessing private variables through public methods (`get_info()` and `Student_Details()`).
3. Ensuring the honors logic (`__honors()`) is hidden and only accessed via a public method.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required; the project uses the built-in **Tkinter** module.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script in any Python 3.x environment:
   ```bash
   python Honors_list(Encapsulation).py
